[BriScala](https://github.com/Agostax0/PPS-24-Briscala) is a project developed for the Software and Development paradigms, in junctions with 2 other university colleagues.

This project aims to make a DSL using Scala3's features, this DSL facilitates the development of card games based on [Briscola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briscola).


During the development, my team and I adopted modern development techniques like [SCRUM](https://www.scrum.org/learning-series/what-is-scrum/), [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) and [Continuos Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)/[Continuos Delivery](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery) via Github Workflows.

Documentation and more information about the development process can be found at the [Github Pages site](https://agostax0.github.io/PPS-24-Briscala) for the repository.
